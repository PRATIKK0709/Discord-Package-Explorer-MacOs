# Discord Data Package Analysis Explanation

## 1. How Data is Fetched
The analysis tools scan the directory structure of your Discord Data Package.
- **Raw Structure**: A script recursively walks through every folder and file, recording names, sizes, and types. This creates a complete map of all files.
- **Processed Data**: A smart script looks for specific important files:
    - `Account/user.json`: Reads your personal profile data.
    - `Messages/`: Iterates through the thousands of channel folders. It looks inside each for `channel.json` to determine if it's a Direct Message or a Server Channel, and checks the size of `messages.json` to estimate how much conversation history is there.

## 2. Process Processing & Structuring
The raw data is massive (often gigabytes), so we process it to make it useful:
- **Categorization**: Channels are split into "Direct Messages" and "Guild (Server) Channels".
- **Ranking**: Channels are sorted by their file size, effectively highlighting your most active conversations.
- **User Metadata**: Key info like your Username, Email, and ID is extracted to the top level.
- **Server List**: We list the servers found in the `Servers` folder to provide a quick overview of joined communities.

## 3. Displaying in a Discord Package Explorer
The `processed_display.json` file is designed to power a UI:
- **Dashboard**: Shows total stats (e.g., "Total DMs: 1542", "Servers: 55").
- **Navigation**:
    - **Top DMs**: A list of your top 100 most active DMs.
    - **Top Channels**: Your top 100 active server channels.
    - **Search**: A full index of all channels allows for searching by ID.
- **Visuals**: The JSON structure groups related data, making it easy to display a "User Profile" card, a "Server List" sidebar, and a main "Content Area" for browsing message history.

This approach ensures that even with 50,000+ files, the Explorer loads instantly because it reads the *Index* (`processed_display.json`) instead of crawling the hard drive every time.
